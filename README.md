# PPOL 6081 - Problem Set 01

This repository contains the first problem set for Text as Data Course

**Deadline:** 11:59pm of September 29

## General Rules for Problem Sets

- (i) Your submissions should be in a Markdown/Quarto/Jupyter file. Commentary, responses, and/or solutions should all be written in Markdown and explain sufficiently the outputs. Submit your file compiled with the results. 

- (ii) all code must run;

- (iii) solutions should be readable

    -   Code should be thoroughly commented - the Professor should be able to understand the code purpose by reading the comment,
    -   Coding solutions should be broken up into individual code chunks in RMD/Quarto Notebooks, not clumped together into one large code chunk;
     

## Step by Step to submit your assignment

You should be familiar with the steps required to work on Github. 

In any case, if you follow the steps below, you should be able to solve all required tasks. 

If you are struggling with GitHub, please come to my office hours!

## Working locally in your assignment

### Step 1

The first step is to clone your assignment to your local machine

```
git clone <repository_name>
```

This will create a folder in your local working directory. This folder is a local GitHub repository. You should `cd` into that folder. 

### Step 2

Your problem set is fully described in the notebook `_ps_set_01.qmd`. 

You can open `.qmd` using RStudio 

Read your assignment carefully. 

All your assignment is contained in the notebook.

### Step 3

Submit your assignment via GitHub, via stage, commit, and push. 

- Remember: this is an individual assignment.
